I'd be happy to help you with that. Could you please provide me with the Python code you'd like me to include in the HTML?"},{"role":"user","content":"use the solution for Leetcode 1"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Certainly! Here's a Python solution for LeetCode problem 1: Two Sum.\n\n```python\ndef twoSum(nums, target):\n    num_dict = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in num_dict:\n            return [num_dict[complement], i]\n        num_dict[num] = i\n    return []\n\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 9\nresult = twoSum(nums, target)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nNow, let's create a beautiful HTML page to showcase this code. Here's an example:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Python Code in HTML</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            background-color: #f2f2f2;\n            padding: 20px;\n        }\n        pre {\n            background-color: #fff;\n            padding: 20px;\n            border-radius: 5px;\n            box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n            overflow-x: auto;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Python Code in HTML</h1>\n    <h2>LeetCode Problem 1: Two Sum</h2>\n    <pre>\n        <code>\ndef twoSum(nums, target):\n    num_dict = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in num_dict:\n            return [num_dict[complement], i]\n        num_dict[num] = i\n    return []\n\nnums = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget = 9\nresult = twoSum(nums, target)\nprint(result)\n        </code>\n    </pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nYou can save the above HTML code in a file with a .html extension (e.g., `code.html`) and open it in a web browser to see the beautiful HTML page with the Python code displayed in a nicely formatted manner.\n\nI hope this helps!
